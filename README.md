# GHOSTY PACMAN - Group 33 Reimagined Potato
We re-created Pac-Man in 3D. [Watch Game Trailor on YouTube](https://youtu.be/c720pBMu_3k).<br><br>
Pac-Man is originally developed and released in 1980 by the Japanese company, Namco (Puck Man). It becomes one of the most successful arcade game in the history. Over the years, a lot of variations emerge from different places across the whole world. 40 years later, we, Reimagined Potato, decided to recreate the game, but in 3D. Upon this stage, we have created a working version of this game for both Windows and Mac; however, this is NOT our destination. Soonly enough, we will create VR version of this game and let the hard-core gamers to have the opportunity to enjoy the classic classic old but gold game.<br><br>
***Anyway. Enjoy.***

## Explanation of the Game

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository with the command
   `git clone https://github.com/Graphics-and-Interaction-COMP30019/project-2-project2_group_33.git ReimaginedPotato`
2. Import the folder `ReimaginedPotato` as an Unity project in *Unity Hub*.
3. click da lil play button lah
4. If it does not work, the reason may be, according to our past experience, because of different platforms (i.e. Windows/macOS). `Reimport All` solves the problem.

**OR**

Simply open the `GhostyPacman.exe` or `GhostyPacman.app` depending on your operating system and that should be working just fine.
